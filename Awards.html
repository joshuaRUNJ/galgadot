    <h1>HERE THE TEN FACTS ABOUT GL GADOT</h1>
    <p class="i">
        
Gal Gadot spoke about herself and her husband branching out in a new way! She said, "As producers, we want to help bring stories that have inspired us to life. Pilot Wave [their production company] will create content that promotes the perspectives and experiences of unique people and produce impactful stories aimed at igniting the imagination." She also revealed that she ad her husband make a great team together.
    </p>
    <p class="i">
        According to Elle Australia, Gal Gadot admitted, "I enjoy doing my own stunts. I love being active and physical. I used to dance which was great training but I also loved motorcycles but I thought it best to give them up when I became a mother." Her stunt work is nothing short of impressive. She really knows what she is doing in some of the most physical and intense action scenes.
    </p>
    <p class="i">
        True fans of Gal Gadot know that she was hiding a massive secret while filming reshoots of Wonder Woman back in 2016. She was five months pregnant! They were able to film her at all the right angles and even edit out her baby bump with CGI when it was necessary. She hid her pregnancy well. Motherhood is definitely her vibe!
    </p>


    <div class="rt"></div>
    <p class="i">
        In her interview with Live with Kelly and Ryan, Gal  Gadot said, "I was training six months prior to the shoots and six hours a day I did two hours of gym work, two hours of fight choreography, and one and a half-hour [to] two hours [of] horseback riding … It was a lot more intense [than the army] by far."
    </p>
    <p class="i">
        According to E Online, Gal Gadot was having her doubts about the life-changing role that changed her career forever. She said, "There's so much 'no.' There's so much rejection in this world that I thought, 'Maybe it's not for me. …Maybe I should go back to law school instead of dragging my family with me.'" She ended up landing the part and moving forward in her career the way she'd hoped for.
    </p>
    <p class="i">
        Gal Gadot's athleticism is obvious! After seeing her pull off so many cool stunts as Wonder Woman, it's easy to question where she got all her skills from. She said, "My mother was a PE teacher so I grew up playing volleyball, tennis, basketball ... I was a high jumper. I was very, very active."
    </p>
    <div class="we"></div>
    <p class="i">
        When asked about what she did before acting, Gal Gadot said, "I was a combat instructor. I was never on the field doing anything dangerous or with weapons. I was in the gym training soldiers and keeping them in shape. I did that for two years. I did learn to use a weapon in boot camp. But I was never in a situation where I had to use one." What an intense thing to do at such a young age!
    </p>
    <p class="i">
        Olga Kurylenko is the actress who ended up snagging the 2007 Bond girl role but Gal Gadot was definitely up for consideration. She wasn't exactly too wrapped up in the idea of it though. In fact, she didn't want to skip school to attend the audition. She did end up auditioning and obviously not getting the part but at least she put herself out there.
    </p>
    <p class="i">
        Gal Gadot has been married to her husband since 2008. That is a long time now! His name is Yaron Varsano and he is an Israeli real estate developer and a businessman. The two have a ten-year age gap which isn't much considering some of the wider and crazier age gaps between Hollywood couples that we know of today.
